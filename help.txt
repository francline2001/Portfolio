I AM CODING USING NOTEPAD

WHY NOTEPAD?

 VS CODE ILIJAM VILE WATOTO WALITUMIA LAPPY... I HAVE TO UPGARDE THE WINDOWS
BUT I ALREADY HAVE THE PROJECT ON GITHUB

What stack or tech?

its just a normal like using html na css only to build a personal portfolio

your entry page to home should be index.html
ok, lemme change


i am doing the right thing?

push the code to github

can i do it manually  without using the commdand prompt ok i thought you have an existing project?
yeah, maybe unisaidie kuipush
